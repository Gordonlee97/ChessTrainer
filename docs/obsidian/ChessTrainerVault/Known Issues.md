# Known Issues

Open items only. When something is fixed, **delete its entry** — no tombstones.
Severity is about consequence, not effort.

## Blocks Plan 2

None. Both prior blockers were settled on 2026-08-04:

- **Transpositions** — decided, not fixed. The tree stays path-addressed and
  Plan 2 dedupes *evaluations* by FEN instead. See
  [[Decisions/Transposition Identity]] for what that makes harder. The test that
  overstated the behaviour had already been renamed to "reuses an existing node
  when the same move is replayed from the same parent".
- **React 18 in the spec** — amended to React 19, with a dated note in §3
  recording the correction.

## Correctness — low consequence

### Grace-timer cleanup covers only the pending search

**Where:** `src/engine/engine.ts` — `dispose()`, `handleTransportError`
Both clear only the *pending* search's grace timer. After a supersede, the armed
timer belongs to the superseded search and is not cleared.

Benign in practice: roughly a 2-second closure leak past teardown, and an
ownership guard prevents a stale timer clobbering live state. But
`clearGraceTimer`'s docstring **overstates its coverage**, which is how this
becomes a real bug later. A proper fix needs a per-search timer registry.

### `transport.send('stop')` before grace arming is unguarded

**Where:** `src/engine/engine.ts`
Unreachable today, because `postMessage` does not throw on a terminated worker.
Reachable if the transport is ever changed.

### `pathTo` has no cycle cap

**Where:** `src/tree/tree.ts`
Would loop forever on a cyclic `parentId`. Unreachable through the public API;
there is no defensive bound.

### `setEval` is inconsistent with its siblings

**Where:** `src/tree/tree.ts`
Silently no-ops on an unknown node, while `insertMove` and `select` throw. This
was plan-specified, but the inconsistency is a trap.

### `buildVerdict` mis-formats a mate-vs-non-mate comparison

**Where:** `src/explain/compare.ts` — `buildVerdict`
The decisive-gap branch renders `(gap / 100).toFixed(2)` pawns. `toCentipawns`
scores mate lines near ±100000 (`MATE_SCORE` minus distance), so comparing a
mate line against a non-mate line produces a gap in the hundreds of thousands —
rendered as something like "M4 is clearly stronger here — about 998.00 better
than Nc3." The number is nonsensical; nothing else about the verdict breaks.

Found during Task 8 (`compareLines`), deferred as out of scope for that task's
brief. Task 9 (the compare drawer, `src/ui/CompareDrawer.tsx`) renders
`comparison.verdict` directly, so this is now user-facing rather than only
reachable in tests — worth fixing before Plan 3, not urgently. A fix needs a
branch in `buildVerdict` for "either side has `mate !== null`" that names the
mate distance instead of formatting the raw gap.

## Dead code and cleanup

- **`Engine.stop()` has no callers** and does no bookkeeping.
  `src/engine/engine.ts`
- **`tsconfig.json` includes `types: ["node"]`**, which is unnecessary —
  `node:fs` resolves via `@types/node` regardless. Drop it next time that file is
  touched.
- **`src/App.tsx` is an inline-styled placeholder**, not the designed layout.
- **The store's `reset` action has no caller.** No new-game control exists.

## Test coverage gaps

- No test covers queenside castled squares (c1/c8) in `extractFeatures`.
- No test covers the `mobility === null` path.
- `hanging` counts a **pinned defender as a valid defender**. This is standard
  `chess.attackers()` control semantics and is correct per the global
  constraint — but it is undocumented, unlike the `castled` approximation, which
  has a comment explaining itself.

## Environment

### `npm audit` reports 5 vulnerabilities, 1 critical

All in the dev toolchain (the Vitest UI dependency tree). **None reach the
production bundle.** Re-check before any public deployment, but this does not
block development.

### A missing sound file returns HTML, not a 404

Observed 2026-08-04 on the Vite dev server: requesting `/sounds/move.mp3` with no
file present returns `index.html` with a 200, via SPA fallback — so Howler
receives an HTML body and fails to *decode* rather than failing to *fetch*.

`SoundManager`'s failed-load path handles this correctly and the app degrades as
designed, so there is nothing to fix. Worth knowing because it means the
"missing file" case is actually exercised as "corrupt file", and a future change
to load-failure handling must keep covering both.
